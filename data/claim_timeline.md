24/7 hotline. Times reflect when each utterance began.

**Date:** 2024-01-03

**Participants:**

- **CR:** Yael Ben-Haim, Claims Representative  

- **IC:** Insured – Dana Cohen  

> Non-essential hesitations and repetitions removed; emotional tone tags

> retained when relevant.

---

**20:03:11 – Call connects**

- **CR:** “Good evening, you’ve reached Magen Insurance emergency line,

  this is Yael speaking. Am I speaking with the policy holder?”

- **IC:** “Yes, hi, it’s Dana Cohen. I, uh, I think I had an accident.

  I mean, I did. I hit a parked car.”

**20:03:27**

- **CR:** “Dana, I’m glad you called. First I need to check you’re safe.

  Are you in a safe place right now?”

- **IC:** “I’m at home now. The accident was about half an hour ago.

  A friend drove me back.”

**20:03:40**

- **CR:** “Okay. Were you injured? Are you in pain at the moment?”

- **IC:** “My back hurts a bit and my neck is stiff, but it’s probably nothing.

  I’m just shaken up.”

**20:03:52**

- **CR:** “Thank you. I’ll still ask a few questions about injuries, just

  to be sure. Immediately after the accident, did medical staff check you?”

- **IC:** “The ambulance came, yes, they checked me.”

**20:04:03**

- **CR:** “Did they take you to the hospital by ambulance or did you go

  some other way?”

- **IC:** “No, I didn’t go with them. I signed that I refuse. I felt silly

  going in an ambulance for ‘nothing’.”

**20:04:17**

- **CR:** “So just to confirm for the record: the ambulance **offered**

  transport, and you **refused ambulance transport at the scene**. Correct?”

- **IC:** “Yes, that’s right.”

**20:04:28**

- **CR:** “Understood. I’ll note that. Are you feeling dizzy now?

  Any nausea, blurred vision, or trouble speaking?”

- **IC:** “A bit dizzy before, but not now. No nausea. I’m talking fine,

  I think.”

**20:04:44**

- **CR:** “All right. I’m going to open a claim file and then we’ll talk

  about next steps, including medical care. Can you tell me the date and

  time of the accident as precisely as you remember?”

- **IC:** “Tonight, third of January, around twenty to eight. Maybe 19:40.”

**20:04:59**

- **CR:** “And the location?”

- **IC:** “At the intersection of Jaffa Road and Shlomzion HaMalka Street,

  in Jerusalem. I was coming down Jaffa and the road was wet.”

**20:05:15**

- **CR:** “Were there any other moving vehicles involved, or did you only

  hit a parked car?”

- **IC:** “Only the parked car. I braked because the cars in front slowed

  down suddenly, I slipped, and I slid into the parked one.”

**20:05:28**

- **CR:** “Did the police arrive at the scene?”

- **IC:** “Yes. They took my statement and said I’d get the report in about

  ten days.”

**20:05:40**

- **CR:** “Thank you. I’ll ask a few more questions for the vehicle damage

  part, and then return to your health. What is the license plate?”

- **IC:** “Seventy-one dash two three four dash five six.”

**20:05:55**

- **CR:** “And the make and model?”

- **IC:** “Mazda 3, 2019.”

**20:06:04**

- **CR:** “Understood. Regarding your back and neck pain, from one to ten,

  how strong is the pain right now, where zero is no pain and ten is

  the worst you can imagine?”

- **IC:** “Maybe… six? It hurts when I move.”

**20:06:20**

- **CR:** “Given your symptoms and the airbags deploying, we strongly

  recommend that you see a doctor as soon as possible, ideally the ER

  tonight or first thing tomorrow morning. Would you be able to go to

  Shaare Zedek or another nearby hospital?”

- **IC:** “I can go in the morning. I don’t want to go back out tonight.”

**20:06:39**

- **CR:** “Okay. Please write this down: if your symptoms worsen tonight

  — stronger pain, dizziness, vomiting, confusion — go straight to the

  ER or call emergency again. I’ll note that we advised ER evaluation.

  I’m now opening the claim with the information you gave.”

**20:06:55**

- **IC:** “Okay. Thank you. Sorry if I’m rambling.”

- **CR:** “You’re doing fine, Dana. I’ll summarize what we have and then

  explain how the claim process works.”

options, and explanation of bodily injury claim process. These sections

are omitted here for brevity but present in the full PDF.)*

## Document 3 – Adjuster Site Visit Report

**Document type:** Field adjuster report  

**Date of visit:** **2024-02-01**  

**Adjuster:** **Amir Levi**  

### Vehicle Inspection

- Front bumper: crushed and partially detached.  

- Right headlight: cracked with condensation inside housing.  

- Hood: mildly crumpled with V-shaped deformation.  

- Airbags: driver and front passenger airbags deployed; dashboard panel damaged.  

- Chassis: no visible bending or twisting; alignment to be checked at garage.  

- Underbody: minor scraping near front subframe; no fluid leaks observed.  

- No evidence of prior bodywork or repainting in the damaged area.

### Scene Reconstruction

Adjuster visited the intersection of **Jaffa Road and Shlomzion HaMalka**.

Observations:

- Parking bay along the curb where the Honda Civic had been parked is now

  occupied by other vehicles.  

- Municipal light pole appears recently replaced (fresh paint, no scratches).  

- Road markings are clear; skid marks faintly visible on wet asphalt

  approximately 15–20 m before the parking bay.  

- Street cameras present on two poles. Municipality requires formal written

  request for access to footage.

Adjuster reviewed police sketch and preliminary report:

- No indication of third-party vehicle collision.  

- Statement from bystander confirms wet road and sudden braking by the insured.

### Comments

- Damage pattern is consistent with insured’s description: loss of control

  while braking on wet road, sliding into parked car and then light pole.  

- No evidence suggesting mechanical failure or foreign object on road at the

  point of braking.  

- No visible contradictions between police report, FNOL, and physical damage.

### Recommendation

Approve vehicle repair costs per garage estimate (**NIS 18,400**) minus

deductible (**NIS 1,800**).  

Monitor bodily injury component separately pending full medical documentation.

## Document 6 – Settlement Email Thread

**Document type:** Email correspondence  

**Date of final settlement email:** **2024-05-20**  

**From:** Adv. Ronen Azulay (counsel for insured)  

**To:** Claims Adjuster – Magen Insurance (Adv. Liat Peretz)  

### Excerpt – 2024-05-10 (Insured’s Counsel)

> Our client has endured significant pain and functional limitations for

> months following the accident. She was unable to work for an extended

> period and continues to suffer daily. We believe a fair settlement for

> pain, suffering, and lost wages is **NIS 120,000**.  

>  

> The refusal of ambulance transport at the scene must be understood in

> context: Ms. Cohen was in shock and minimized her own symptoms. The

> subsequent ER report and physiotherapy records clearly document a

> clinically significant whiplash-type injury.

### Excerpt – 2024-05-16 (Insurer’s Counsel)

> Our review of the medical and physiotherapy documentation indicates a

> soft-tissue injury with good recovery and return to work within

> approximately two months. There is no evidence of structural damage or

> permanent impairment.  

>  

> We acknowledge the period of work disruption and agree that some

> compensation for pain and suffering is appropriate. However, we cannot

> accept the proposed amount of **NIS 120,000**, which we view as

> disproportionate to the objective findings.  

>  

> We are prepared to offer **NIS 35,000** in full and final settlement of the

> bodily injury component.

### Final Agreement – 2024-05-20

After further negotiation, the parties agree as follows:

- Vehicle damage: Paid separately, **NIS 18,400** less **NIS 1,800** deductible.  

- Bodily injury settlement: **NIS 45,000** in full and final settlement.  

- Settlement date: **2024-05-20**.  

- Parties confirm that no claim for future loss of earnings or permanent

  disability is pursued.

---

### Needle Data Note (for internal documentation only)

- The **refusal of ambulance transport at the scene** is a relatively sparse

  detail:

  - It appears clearly in the high-resolution incident log and the FNOL

    transcript/intake note,  

  - It is only alluded to briefly in settlement correspondence.  

- This makes it a good **"needle" fact** for retrieval experiments and

  evaluation questions such as:

  - "Did the insured refuse ambulance transport at the scene?"
